    "This notebook is designed to help identify and resolve response delays in the control code of a robotic arm. You will:\n",
    "- Diagnose the root cause of delays in command response times.\n",
    "- Optimize control code for improved performance.\n",

    "Follow the steps outlined in this notebook to diagnose and resolve issues in the robotic arm's control system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Libraries**: Run the first code cell to load necessary Python libraries.\n",
    "2. **Run Diagnostic Functions**: Use the provided `check_response_time` function to measure command response times.\n",
    "3. **Analyze Findings**: Document any observed delays and propose a hypothesis for the cause.\n",
    "4. **Test Optimizations**: Apply optimization logic and compare results.\n",
    "5. **Record Results**: Use structured documentation to summarize your findings and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes:\n",
    "- Focus on the `rotate_joint` command, as this has been flagged for delays.\n",
    "- Use the markdown cells to record your observations and findings.\n"
